Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
Exception: gamma_lpdf: Shape parameter is inf, but must be finite!  (in 'unknown file name' at line 13)

If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.

Samples were drawn using NUTS at Mon Aug  8 16:58:02 2022.
For each parameter, n_eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
convergence, Rhat=1).

If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.


Gradient evaluation took 0.024796 seconds
1000 transitions using 10 leapfrog steps per transition would take 247.96 seconds.

Exception: gamma_lpdf: Shape parameter is inf, but must be finite!  (in 'unknown file name' at line 19)

If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.

Samples were drawn using NUTS at Mon Aug  8 18:15:20 2022.
For each parameter, n_eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
convergence, Rhat=1).
